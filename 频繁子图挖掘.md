##  Reviewer: 1

### Recommendation: 
Author Should Prepare A Major Revision For A Second Review

### Comments:
In this paper, the authors studied the problem of frequent subgraph mining under the differential privacy model. They presented a two-phase differentially private frequent subgraph mining algorithm DFG. In DFG, frequent subgraphs are privately identified in the first phase, and the noisy support of each identified frequent subgraph is calculated in the second phase. The authors showed the `$\epsilon$`-differential privacy of the proposed algorithm through analysis. Experiments are also conducted to examine the performance of the proposed algorithm.
This paper could be improved from the following perspectives.

1.  The notation system(==符号系统==) of this paper is not well defined, which easily make the audience lost. A notation table would be a good idea for quick reference. Also, all the notations should be well defined and explained before using.  ==建议建立符号表，符号在使用之前应该先定义并且解释清楚==

 2.Compared to the conference version, new essential contents are not sufficient. The authors may consider to add some new material. ==相比于会议版本，新版里重点内容不够，建议添加一些新的内容==

 3.The utility measures used in the paper are F-score and Relative Error. According to the recent work “SecGraph: A Uniform and Open-source Evaluation System for Graph Data Anonymization and De-anonymization”, such fundamental utility measure may not well capture the true utility of the data for upper level applications, e.g., data mining and machine learning tasks. Therefore, further evaluation (measures) and/or justification may be needed to examine the utility of the data after adding noise. ==根据最新的论文，F-score和RE这两个评价指标对于该场景不太使用，建议测试一些其他的评价指标==

 4.All the proposed algorithm should be well analyzed, including from the complexity perspective. ==论文中提出的算法都应该进一步分析，尤其是算法复杂度的分析==

 5.Careful proofreading is necessary.==仔细校对书写错误==

## Reviewer: 2

### Recommendation
Author Should Prepare A Minor Revision

### Comments:
The paper is the latest effort in applying differential privacy to the problem of mining frequent subgraphs. The authors proposed a sophisticated multi-step approach including getting the (noisy) number of frequent subgraphs, identifying the frequent set and computing the support of the frequent set.
Overall I think the paper provides a valid approach to the problem and has proved that the proposed approach satisfies `$epsilon$`-DP. I have the following questions which may not require a 'major revision' of the paper but these questions/comments should be addressed before publication:

1. In the conditional exponential method, the noise added to each candidate subgraph is only proportional to the number of frequent subgraphs $n_i$, which was obtained from the previous step, although it is applied on all subgraphs. Can you discuss the rationale behind it and help the readers to connect the dots between these steps? ==在条件exponential方法中，添加的噪音和频繁子图的个数$n_1$成比例，$n_i$从上面一步获得，而且在所有子图中都会用到。解释其中的原理==

2. In section 7, most of the discussion has focused on the nodes along a certain path of the lattice, including Algorithm 4 where the privacy budget is distributed among the path sets. However, it should be common that a node can appear in multiple path sets. How do you handle such scenario? 
   ==文中讨论的都是节点沿着lattice中指定path的情况，但是一个节点可能出现在多个path集合中，这种情况怎么解决的？？？==

3. The proposed approach runs in $O(|NS|^2)$ for Algorithm 5 where |NS| is the number of nodes in the lattice. We know that the lattice is huge and could contain millions of nodes. Then in the experiment it is shown that time performance is almost as good as the none-private version of the frequent subgraph mining algorithm. This sounds like a little too good. Would you be able to publish the implementation of the approach online if this work gets published? That way other researchers could reproduce the experiment results in this paper. ==差分隐私算法的时间复杂度应该高于非差分隐私算法的时间复杂度。文章提出的算法的时间复杂度为$O(\left| {NS} \right|^2)$，按实验结果部分所言，这个算法的时间复杂度和差分隐私算法的时间复杂度几乎一致，这种情况好的有点太好了！==

4. About writing: there are too much detailed description of the proposed approach in the introduction before the contribution section.  Without the proper problem setting introduced later, readers are not able to comprehend those. I would recommend trimming it and keep the description at a higher level.==在contribution之前的introduction中说了太多算法的细节，读者在对问题认识不充分地情况下难以理解。建议缩减introduction，并且尽可能地从high level的角度描述==
   In related work, paragraph 4, 'For differentially private FSM, ...' I think this is the first time FSM is mentioned in the section yet there is no mention of what it stands for. ==在相关工作介绍的第四段中，FSM术语第一次提到，但是没有具体介绍。==I believe reference [5] deals with the same problem and I wonder why it is called FSM while this paper uses the term FGM in the very beginning. ==第5个reference解决了类似的问题，使用的是FSM，为什么文章使用FGM呢？？==
   The paper needs more examples to help the reader understand the problem setting and certain notions, for example, what exactly is 'the maximal size of frequent subgraphs' (2nd paragraph, section 4)?
   ==文章需要更多的例子让读者更好地理解，如什么是“子图的最大size”==

1. 问题：
    * 子图同构检测算法的复杂度
    * 频繁项集挖掘

2. 要做的事情：

    * 看韩家炜的《数据挖掘》中的频繁模式挖掘部分
    * 查找子图同构算法的资料


## 2017.5.24

1. 二分查找加入的噪音为什么是$O(logN)$级别的？要找到支持度第m大的子图就要排序，要进行m次比较进行比较，这样加的噪音应该是$O(N)$级？

2. 在条件指数机制中，添加噪音的操作在每个候选子图上都要进行，为什么最后每个候选子图添加的噪音的规模为只有$O(n_i)​$，而不是$O(|C_i|)​$？？

3. 子图同构检测的时间复杂度

## 2017.6.7

1. 论文中用到的数据集
* Cancer
* HIV
* SPL


## 2017.6.12

1. 发现论文中的问题：

    candidate subgraph怎么生成的？
不能随便加一条边就结束了？这样后面计算支持度的时候所有支持度都为0，
但是这样没有意义，只会增加计算支持度的复杂度！


2. 二分查找怎么用的？？根据真实支持度排序的？？如果根据是这样，那还有什么意义吗？

3. 急需解决的问题：

    1. 查找sub-lattice的算法描述。
        
        * 使用层序遍历，找出所有入度为0的node，
        * 以上述每个node为根生成sub-lattice.
        * 计算每个sub-lattice中每个node的noisy support,
            如果有node存在于多个sub-lattice中，
            使用论文中的方法更新其noisy support。
        * 返回每个node到其noisy support的map。
        
    2. 为什么频繁项集和频繁子图不能用sub-lattice的方法？
        这个问题怎么搞？？？？
